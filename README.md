# Weather App in Python using Tkinter module 

# Modules required:

Tkinter: It is a built-in python library for making GUI using tkinter toolkit.
Requests: It is a library which helps in fetching the data with the help of URL.

# Approach:
Firstly, we have to use a weather API for fetching the data from the Open Weather Map website by generating an API key, and then we need to create a configuration file to store the key. And finally using that configuration file in the python script.
